# Notes-App

Since you will be learning a pletheora of information during Capital One's software engineering summit, let's build an app for taking notes. While building this app we'll cover the basics of iOS.

## Content

In this repo, you'll find the end result of the Notes App.

Please see [StepByStepInstructions.md](StepByStepInstructions.md) for detailed instructions on building this app. During the presentation you can use the instructions to follow along.

## Bonus Functionality

If you're feeling up to it, here is some additionaly functionality to work on.

### Add Persistence

As you've probably noticed by now, when you close the app and re-open it, all of your data is gone. In order to keep all your data you'll need to add persistence. There are many options available to accomplish this, here are some options:
  
* [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html)
* [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest)
* [NSUserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
  
### Add UI Constraints

Currently the app only works for certain screen sizes. Make it so the app looks great on any iPhone or iPad in any orientation!
